# weather-modelling
This project involves creating a weather modeling graph using Python. The graph aims to visualize and analyze weather data to identify patterns and trends. This can be particularly useful for meteorologists, data scientists, and hobbyists interested in weather forecasting.

Features:

Data Collection: Retrieve weather data from various sources (e.g., APIs, CSV files).
Data Processing: Clean and preprocess the data for analysis.
Visualization: Generate graphs to visualize temperature, humidity, precipitation, and other weather-related metrics.
Analysis: Identify trends, anomalies, and patterns in the weather data.
Requirements:

Python 3.x
Pandas
Matplotlib
NumPy
Requests (if fetching data from an API)
